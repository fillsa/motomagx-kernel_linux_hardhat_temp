# SSID entries:
#
# 1. SSID=""                - to denote NULL SSID, which is considered 
#                             as SSID with length 0.
# 2. SSID="AP_NAME"         - to mention a specific SSID to match.
# 3. SSID="AP_NAME",maxlen  - wildcard AP_NAME will be use to base match
#                             the SSID, and SSID's max length is max length
# 4. SSID="AP_NAME%",%      - wildcard AP_NAME% will be use to match
#                             the SSID with the % being a single char wildcard
# 5. SSID="AP?NAME*",255    - wildcard AP*NAME will be use to match the SSID. 

# SSID Examples:
#
#   SSID="AP_NAME"      # match AP_NAME exactly, generate SSID specific probes
#   SSID="AP_NAME",0    # match AP_NAME exactly, generate SSID specific probes
#   SSID="AP*NAME"      # match AP*NAME exactly, generate SSID specific probes
#   SSID="AP_NAME",7    # match "AP_NAME" exactly, do not generate SSID 
                        #   specific probe requests
#   SSID="AP_NAME*",8   # match "AP_NAME*" exactly, do not generate SSID 
                        #   specific probe requests
#   SSID="AP_NAME",4    # match "AP_N" exactly, do not generate SSID 
                        #   specific probe requests
#   SSID="AP_NAME",9    # match "AP_NAME" as a base and SSID's max length is 9
#   SSID="AP*NAME",*    # match "AP*NAME" where '*' is a single char
#   SSID="AP?NAME",?    # match "AP?NAME" where '?' is a single char
#   SSID="AP?NAME*,255  # match "AP?NAME*" with unix pattern matching

#   For each entry requiring a SSID specific probe request, "Numprobes" of 
#     SSID specific probe requests will be transmitted per channel.  
#
#   If any SSID in the list has a non-zero modifier (wildcard match char, 
#     unix pattern match, maxlen), "Numprobes" of broadcast probe requests 
#     will be transmitted once per channel and the results matched against 
#     all entries.
